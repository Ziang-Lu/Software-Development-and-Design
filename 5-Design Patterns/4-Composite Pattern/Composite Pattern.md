# Composition Pattern

Problem: Many things in the world are **self-referential**, as in **they can contain themselves** in their inherent structure.

e.g., branches may contain branches and leaves, folders may contain folders and files...

-> Composite Pattern is a **structural pattern** that is an OO solution for a **hierarchical structure**.
