How should we organize the software phases into the software development process?

# Software Process Models (软件过程模型) / Software Lifecycle Model (软件生命周期模型)

Main functions:

* Determine the order of the software activities described in "Software Phases"
* Determine the transition criteria for the software activities, i.e., when we can go from one phase to another

## Waterfall Model (瀑布模型)

-> **Follow the set of rigid steps**, i.e., strictly from requirement analysis all the way to system testing

* Pros:

  * Find errors early

* Cons:

  * **Not flexible**

    ***Normally, it is difficult to fully specify requirements at the beginning of a project.***

    => **Far from ideal for most real-world projects**

## Evolutionary Prototyping (演化型)

-> Start with an initial prototype, and evolve it based on the feedback from the customer

<br>

## Rational Unified Process (RUP) / Unified Software Process (USP) (统一软件开发过程)

-> Based on UML

<br>

## Agile Software Process (敏捷软件过程)

-> Sacrifice discipline a little bit, in order to be more flexible, and be more able to account for changes, specifically changes in requirements
