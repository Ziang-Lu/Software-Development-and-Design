# Design Patterns

-> Tried and true solutions to commonly encountered problems in OOD

## Factory Method Pattern (工厂方法模式)

A creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact clss of the object that will be created.

This is done by calling a factory method — either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overriden by derived classes — rather than calling a constructor.

## Composite Pattern (复合模式)

An OO solution for a **hierarchical structure**

## Observer Pattern (观察者模式)

When one (or more) object(s) wants to watch the state of one (or more) other object(s)

Design programs that involve notifications, or one class monitoring another

## Iterator Pattern (迭代器模式)

Iterave over classes that are not in Java Collection
